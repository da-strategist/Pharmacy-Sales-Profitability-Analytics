Objectives 

1. Revenue & Margin Control

    Track revenue, cost, and margin by:

        Store, city, region, country

        Product, brand, category (OTC vs Rx), generic vs branded

        Time (day → month → quarter → year)

    Identify:

        Low-margin products that sell a lot (silent profit killers)

        High-margin, low-volume products (growth opportunities)

2. Store & Regional Performance

    Rank pharmacies by:

        Revenue, margin, margin %

        Units sold per store size band

    Compare:

        Urban vs suburban vs rural performance

        New vs mature stores (using OpenDate)

        Product Portfolio Decisions

    See:

        Which brands and categories actually drive profit

        Whether generics outperform branded products on margin

    Flag:

        Products selling close to or below cost

        Discontinued products still appearing in sales (compliance red flag)

        Promo Effectiveness (High Interest)

    Compare promo vs non-promo:

        Units uplift

        Margin erosion

        Net profit impact

        “Are promotions increasing profit or just volume?”

2. What I immediately want YOU to analyze first (priority order)


2.1: Store Profitability & Variance

Question I care about:

“Why do two similar stores perform very differently?”


        Revenue, margin, and margin % by store

Normalized by:

Store size band

Urban/rural classification

Outlier detection:

Underperforming stores

Best-in-class stores we should learn from

🔥 Priority 2: Product Margin Leakage

Question:

“Where are we bleeding margin without noticing?”

I expect:

Products with:

High sales volume but low or negative margin

Heavy promo dependency

Generic vs branded margin comparison

Category-level margin contribution

🔥 Priority 3: Promotion ROI

Question:

“Which promos should we stop immediately?”

I want:

Promo vs non-promo:

Units sold

Revenue

Margin €

Clear verdict:

Value-creating promos

Volume-only promos

Loss-making promos
